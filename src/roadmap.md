# Development roadmap

We maintain a [development roadmap][dr] that shows both our current
efforts, future work we have in mind, and the overall goals we are
working towards. Many of the items on that map have links that lead to
corresponding issues on the appropriate tracker. Alternatively, if
you're just looking for issues to pick up, you can take a look at
these issue lists on Github:

* [current-sprint issues on chalk](https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/labels/current-sprint)

We are working from a 6-week "sprint cycle". We're still working out
the details of how we organize our sprints. For now, if you'd like to
claim one of the above issues or get involved, though, drop by on [the
rust-lang Zulip] in the [`#t-types`] stream and say hello!
